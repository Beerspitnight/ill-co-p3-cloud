👋 **Welcome to the Ill-Co-P3 Tagging Tool**

Please tag each image-text pair using the design principles and elements you've learned. If you're unsure, trust your first impressions — this is a collaborative, crowdsourced dataset.

---

### 🖼 What if there's *no caption*?
Some images may not include descriptive text. In that case:
- Focus only on the **visual design**
- Use the image itself to decide which principles or elements are present

---

### 🧩 What if I only recognize **one** design principle or element?
That's perfectly fine!
- You can **leave secondary tags blank**
- Only tag what you’re confident about

---

### 🧠 What if I think there are **three or more** principles or elements?
Please choose the **most dominant** or obvious ones:
- Select the **primary** principle/element that stands out most
- (Optional) Add a **secondary** if another is clearly present

We’re capturing high-confidence tags for training — less is more.

---

### 🚫 When should I **reject** an image or mark it **offensive**?

Reject an image if:
- It’s low quality, blurred, or broken
- The content is too abstract or unclear to interpret
- It appears to be a duplicate

Flag as **offensive** only if:
- The image contains nudity, violence, hate speech, or inappropriate material
