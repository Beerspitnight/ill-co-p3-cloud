      "name": "Simplicity",
      "definition": "Simplicity is achieved by removing non-essential elements and reducing visual noise, leading to better usability.",

        {
          "name": "Reduction",
          "steps": [
            "Decide what must be conveyed by the design.",
            "Critically evaluate every UI element.",
            "Remove any element that isn\u2019t essential."
          ],
          "example": "Google\u2019s homepage removes all nonessential links to focus entirely on the search bar."

          "steps": [
            "Use UI elements that serve multiple purposes.",
            "Leverage affordances that support multiple mental models (e.g., scroll thumb for position + navigation)."
